Welcome, Skidders & Larpers! I made this because the Roblox Exploit Community is "totally" in a nutshell. There are a lot of incompetent members, and they obviously need help with memory manipulation and how it works. I also made this out of boredom.

What's Memory
  Answer: Think of memory as data stored on your computer and within the game you're trying to gain access to. Memory is crucial for creating cheats because it's necessary to modify game data, both externally and internally.

Ways to Manipulate Memory
 - Using Pointers (Pointers are just variables that store memory addresses (location of memory) by Manipulating Pointers you could gain direct access and modify data stored in those locations)

Only going to speak on pointers since it's probably the only thing you incompetent beings can comprehend.

Example of Pointer:
Heads up!
ptr means Pointer (just like to shorten my use of words)
var means Variable
int means Integer

{ Also this was coded in Cpp {C++} }
[
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int uwu = 10; // declared the current int
    int *ptr;     // declared the ptr var | [Here]
  
    ptr = &uwu;   // assign the addy of 'uwu' to the ptr var

    std::cout << "Value: " << num << std::endl;
    std::cout << "value appointed " << *ptr << endl;

    // changing the value directly using the pointer
    *ptr = 20;

    std::cout << "new value: " << uwu << std::endl;

    return 0;
]
Hopefully this gives u a easy understanding on what a pointer does ( It'll be simple depending on the game. )
