### Welcome, Skidders & Larpers!

I made this because the Roblox Exploit Community is "totally" in a nutshell. There are a lot of incompetent members, and they obviously need help with memory manipulation and how it works. I also made this out of boredom.

#### What's Memory?

Think of memory as data stored on your computer and within the game you're trying to gain access to. Memory is crucial for creating cheats because it's necessary to modify game data, both externally and internally.

#### Ways to Manipulate Memory

- **Using Pointers**: Pointers are just variables that store memory addresses (location of memory). By manipulating pointers, you could gain direct access and modify data stored in those locations. Only going to speak on pointers since it's probably the only thing you incompetent beings can comprehend.

#### Example of Pointer

```	cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int uwu = 10; // declared the current int
    int *ptr;     // declared the ptr var
  
    ptr = &uwu;   // assign the addy of 'uwu' to the ptr var

    cout << "Value: " << uwu << endl;
    cout << "Value appointed: " << *ptr << endl;

    // changing the value directly using the pointer
    *ptr = 20;

    cout << "New value: " << uwu << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Hopefully, this gives you an easy understanding of what a pointer does (It'll be simple depending on the game).

#### Sites & YouTube Videos for Learning Programming Languages

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com): This is the least obvious troll, lol. Only use ChatGPT to help fix errors or if you need genuine help.
- [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/): Learn C++ here.
- [LearnCS.org](https://www.learncs.org/): Learn C# here.
- [Pointers Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ybLD6_2gKM): More help on pointers.
- [Memory Manipulation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4ZeMfDC7k): This could help with general memory manipulation, understanding of pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

This was a short introduction. I'll talk more about this later! See you later, skiddies! :D
